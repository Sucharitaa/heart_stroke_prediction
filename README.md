This data science endeavor endeavors to craft a model that can predict the probability of an individual experiencing a stroke based on a comprehensive set of attributes. The dataset incorporates various parameters that are crucial for stroke prediction. Each entry corresponds to a patient and encompasses the following details:

# Overview of Data Attributes
1. ID: A unique identifier for each patient.
2. Gender: Indicates whether the patient is "Male", "Female", or falls into the category of "Other".
3. Age: The age of the patient, a fundamental factor in stroke risk assessment.
4. Hypertension: A binary indicator denoting whether the patient has hypertension, with 0 representing the absence and 1 indicating the presence of hypertension.
5. Heart Disease: Another binary feature indicating whether the patient has any heart diseases, with 0 representing the absence and 1 indicating the presence of heart disease.
6. Ever Married: Indicates whether the patient has been married, with possible values being "No" or "Yes".
7. Work Type: Specifies the type of employment the patient is engaged in, with categories including "Children", "Govt_job", "Never_worked", "Private", or "Self-employed".
8. Residence Type: Indicates whether the patient resides in a "Rural" or "Urban" area.
9. Average Glucose Level: Reflects the average glucose level in the patient's blood, which is relevant to their overall health condition.
10. BMI: Represents the Body Mass Index of the patient, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
11. Smoking Status: Specifies the smoking habits of the patient, with options including "Formerly smoked", "Never smoked", "Smokes", or "Unknown".
12. Stroke: The target variable, with a value of 1 indicating that the patient has experienced a stroke and 0 indicating no stroke.

## Conclusion
The overarching goal of this project is to leverage these attributes to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify individuals at risk of stroke. By utilizing various data science methodologies and algorithms, the aim is to enhance the accuracy of the model, thereby enabling timely intervention and preventive measures to mitigate the impact of stroke.
